## FileManagerPRO 2.0

This console app was created for the purpose of learning the C# language.  It allows users to:

- View a table of all files in a directory (including file size and last access timestamp),
- View a table of all subfolders in a directory (much the same idea as above),
- Create, delete, move, rename, read from and write to files,
- Create, delete, move and rename folders,
- Create and save an 'index.txt' file, which displays all of the files and subfolders in a directory, with some useful information,
- CRAZY and WILD console animations,
- a SPOOKY alien themed easter egg,
- hours of fun all round.
