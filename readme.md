## FileManagerPRO 2.0

This console application was created for the purpose of learning the C# language.  It allows users to:

- View a table of all files in a directory (including file size and last access timestamp)
- View a table of all subfolders in a directory (much the same idea as above)
- Create, delete, move, rename, read from and write text to files
- Create, delete, move and rename folders
- Create and save an 'index.txt' file, which displays all of the files and subfolders in a directory, with some useful information (basically the same thing as the first 2 bullet points, but in a HANDY and CONVENIENT text file)
- CRAZY and SPECTACULAR console animations
- A SPOOKY and HILARIOUS alien themed easter egg
- Hours of fun for ALL of the family ┴┬┴┤( ͡° ͜ʖ├┬┴┬

Please enjoy this application responsibly.
